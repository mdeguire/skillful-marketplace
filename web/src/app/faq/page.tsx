    q: "Is this a real company or a joke?",
    a: "Yes. We're a real company that sells real products with a satirical edge. Every item is handcrafted and shipped to your door. The jokes are free.",
  },
  {
    q: "Who makes these products?",
    a: "Actual humans — designers, artists, and makers who may or may not be coping with existential dread about AI. Each product is designed and produced without generative AI.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the return policy?",
    a: "30-day returns on unworn, unused items. We can't take back the existential realization that came with the purchase, though.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you ship internationally?",
    a: "Yes. We ship worldwide because existential crises are a global phenomenon. International shipping rates calculated at checkout.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does shipping take?",
    a: "Domestic orders: 3–7 business days. International: 7–21 days. We don't use teleportation because it hasn't been invented by humans yet.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is the 'replacement likelihood' real?",
    a: "As real as anything on the internet. It's a satirical metric we assign to each product based on vibes, not science. Please don't cite it in your performance review.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use AI to write my product review?",
    a: "We'd prefer you didn't, but we can't stop you. Just know we'll feel a little sad about it.",

    q: "Do you offer wholesale?",
    a: "For select partners who share our values. Contact us at hello@human-tm.com and prove you're not a bot.",
